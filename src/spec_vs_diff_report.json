  "summary": "Implemented a shared error-to-message formatter and updated visit entry create/edit flows to catch backend/client errors and surface sanitized English messages. Added integer-only validation for hospital/medicine charges to avoid BigInt conversion errors. However, the diff also includes unrelated UI/theme changes and import dialog enhancements that were not requested.",

    {
      "description": "Changed global UI/theme styling (calm clinical color palette tokens, chart colors) in global CSS.",
