# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve the visit entry form UX by allowing manual Visit Date typing/editing and providing more space for entering and viewing medicine details.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Visit Date field to allow direct keyboard entry/editing while keeping existing validation, calendar popover selection behavior, and correct saved date handling for new and edited entries.
- Expand the Medicine Name input area to better support longer and/or multi-line text while preserving required-field validation and ensuring the entries list displays long/multi-line medicine text without truncation and with line breaks preserved.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can type or edit the Visit Date directly (or still pick from the calendar) with clear inline errors for invalid dates, and can enter longer medicine information more comfortably and see it fully displayed in the My Entries list.
