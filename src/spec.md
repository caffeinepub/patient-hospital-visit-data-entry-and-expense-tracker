# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Analytics spending charts use clearly distinct, readable colors for Hospital Charges and Medicine Charges across light and dark themes.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Analytics spending graphs to render Hospital Charges and Medicine Charges as two clearly different colored series (not monochrome).
- Ensure the legend markers and tooltip indicators use the same colors as their corresponding chart series in both light and dark mode.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Analytics page, users can easily distinguish Hospital Charges vs Medicine Charges by consistent, clearly different colors in the chart, legend, and tooltips in both light and dark themes.
